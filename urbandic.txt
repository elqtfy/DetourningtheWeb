I want to thank everyone who put they meaning of trill in this dictionary. Some of you are on point and some are way offThis word was formed in 1986 by Eric Charon. (aka Sir Trill.) He took the words true and real to describe his demeanor. He spelled it Treal. He began to use it in the streets of Port Arthur. The word got to UGK rapper Bun B thru a mutual friend of Bun B and Sir Trill. UGK Then released they first underground record called the Southern Way in 1992 which they spelled the word t-r-i-l-l. This became the new spelling that is used today

Tweleb
A (partially) anonymous, popular Twitter user who has nothing else going for them. Twelebs live for RTs and ":&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;D"s from their followers as they tweet ignorant, sometimes funny and mostly offensive content all in the name of retaining their Tweleb status. Every Tweleb&apos;s avatar change is welcomed with dozens of "Avi appreciations" from their followers, to which they&apos;re usual reply is something like: "Wow. Humbled." They are easily recognisable by their amount of followers on Twitter (usually 5000 or more). Their Twitter names are usually their Instagram name or a name promoting the latest cool kid gathering e.g: #coolkidgathering15Oct!!!Though many of them aren&apos;t bad people, they live pretty mediocre lives and for most being a Tweleb is probably as good as it&apos;ll ever get for them.Examples of Twelebs:A grown-ass man who still lives with his Mom but still hasn&apos;t gotten that Diploma that&apos;s taking him at least 5 years (and counting) to complete because he is too busy chasing "ez&apos;weyi".A beyond average girl who has a Tumblr, dresses like Solange, has a septum piercing, wears dark lipstick and portrays herself as a "feminist". Usually looks amazing on Instagram but in real life looks like "ubhontsi."A flaming gay man who lives for Beyonce. His mouth is either full of opinion or full of your boyfriend.
Basic girl 1: "Whooooo Choza, did you see @_____ tweet about going to #coolkidgathering15Oct?"Basic girl 2: "Yes chom! I&apos;m so going! I can&apos;t wait to see my favourite tweleb there!!"

Clam Jam
The female equivalent to the cock block.
If you&apos;re familiar with the term "Cock Block," you know that it means one dude messed up another dude&apos;s game with the ladies. Well, this happens to girls too. And we (most of us) don&apos;t have cocks. If you&apos;ve ever been obviously checking out a guy and then your friend decides to "claim" him by walking up to him and touching his polo shirt and exclaiming, "I&apos;m soooo drunk right now omg!"- you&apos;ve been clam jammed. If you&apos;ve ever been hitting it off with a guy and then you tell him his pong game is weak, you&apos;ve been clam jammed.. by yourself, I might add.

Short story long
Something that could have been told in a more concise way but is dragged out because the teller doesn&apos;t know how to tell a story. It&apos;s a play on the annoying clarifier, "Long story short," people use to sum up a digression, which really never seems to be that short anyway. So instead you say the opposite.
So I was walking into the store the other day, I wanted to get some aspirin because I had this massive headache and I walked down aisle four but they only had Tylenol but that doesn&apos;t work and I went to the counter and short story long this guy was holding up the store!

courtesy fart
When someone accidentally farts and is embarrased, you should, if you have one ready, let one fly as well.  This is a courtesy fart.This is an opportune time for you to release since then the two fart smells will interfere and no one will discover how unbelievibly nasty your ass is.
Boris farted as he bent over to pick up his shuttlecock at the badminton tournament. Shung Fe felt so bad for him that he offered up a courtesy fart. Unfortunately Shung Fe&apos;s rice and eggnoodle fart could not completely mask the liverwurst and vodka fart from Boris, and everyone had to leave the court for 15 minutes.

awesomeness test
1) An act of what appears to be generosity- such as lending an acquaintance a CD or movie, etc., or allowing them to choose what to do for fun- that is really more of a method of evaluating whether or not they&apos;re up to your cool standards. 2) An inner struggle that involves the choice between what you believe is cool and what society tells you is cool; if you allow your sense of coolness to triumph over popular opinion, you have passed the awesomeness test.
1) When she let him pick which club to go to, he thought that she must really be into him, but in reality she was just giving him an awesomeness test. 2) When, against her interests, she went with her friends to see a Fallout Boy concert instead of staying home and watching Quentin Tarantino movies and drinking Coke and rum, she knew she had failed another awesomeness test and was too dejected to even find the fact that the lead singer looks like a monkey humorous.

Thesaurused

"Dobby had to obey Lucius Malfoy because he was his house elf" "Why does Johnny always iron the clothes, vaccum, and fix the vegetables when he could just refuse? He&apos;s such a house elf!!"

retrograde revolution
The theory that history and culture (i.e. fashion, music etc.) repeats itself every couple of decades. Its plausibility draws from the fact that most parents raise their children with the same ideas that their own parents asserted upon them.
There are many similarities between the war in Iraq today and the Vietnam war .. It&apos;s almost like a retrograde revolution. Hopefully, a retrograde revolution involving the 60s and 70s will begin, and groups will actually start playing some real music. The comeback of blazers is part of the retrograde revolution.
